Own NFTs that you can interact with in Augmented Reality based on art in Miami (art like wall paintings in Wynwood on the Stacks blockchain).

## Inspiration
This June, the Blockchain has moved its headquarters from New York to Miami, reasoning it by the welcoming regulatory environment and naming it " a hotbed for crypto innovation". With the introduction of the Miami Coin and the extraordinary rise of NFTs, we were inspired to find a way to take advantage of the current crypto and NFT trends and accelerate Miami's transition into a tech hub. That's how we came up with the idea for the "Mia Art" platform and made a prototype of it.

## What it does
The app creates a platform for artists and creators to tokenize both 2D and 3D art (murals, graffiti, installations, sculptures, and other forms of art). To tokenize 3D art, the artists would use augmented reality technology that would be on the app. Physical art will be tokenized by the use of QR codes or chip installments. 
The platform would be linked to a wallet that would allow collectors to buy the digitalized art with Miami Coins. 

## How we built it
How will we use MiamiCoin?
miamicoin is built on the stacks blockchain, some nft marketplaces have already implemented it. 
Moreover, blockchain.com which has it's headquaters in Miami is planning to launch int's own NFT marketplace based on the Bitcoin blockchain.
So, it's not impossible.

How Do artists have multiple NFT's with one piece of art?
a piece of art will have a qr code which will link to to the collection of the 2d NFTs. 
We would then use the cloud to store images similar to the NFT's.
when a user want's to view it in AR, we would use flannbasedmatching with camera vision to compare the two images.

How to render large files?
We would use Cloud AR by google. This is because Cloud AR tech uses a combination of edge computing and AR technology 
to offload the computing power needed to display large 3D files. More than 1 billion devices support AR, so this is an untapped resource.

Metaverse?
Very possible. With a project like this, the metaverse is within our reach.
